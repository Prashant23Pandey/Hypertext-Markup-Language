    <h1>Understanding the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)</h1>

    <p>The *W3C* stands for the *World Wide Web Consortium. It's an international community where member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop **Web standards*.</p>

    <h2>Who Founded It?</h2>
    <p>The W3C was founded in *1994* by *Tim Berners-Lee*, the inventor of the World Wide Web, after he left CERN.</p>

    <h2>The Primary Purpose of the W3C</h2>
    <p>The central mission of the W3C is to *lead the Web to its full potential* by creating technical standards and guidelines. These standards are essential for ensuring the long-term growth and stability of the Web. Essentially, the W3C ensures the Web remains:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>*Open:* Accessible to everyone, free from control by a single entity.</li>
        <li>*Interoperable:* Web technologies (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) work consistently across all browsers and devices.</li>
        <li>*Accessible:* Usable by people with disabilities (through initiatives like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG).</li>
        <li>*Evolving:* They manage the development and adoption of new technologies and best practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Standards and Technologies</h2>
    <p>The W3C is responsible for developing and maintaining many of the core technologies that make the Web work today, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>*HTML* (HyperText Markup Language)</li>
        <li>*CSS* (Cascading Style Sheets)</li>
        <li>*XML* (Extensible Markup Language)</li>
        <li>*DOM* (Document Object Model)</li>
        <li>*Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)* Guidelines</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In short, when you see a browser successfully display a website, it's because developers and browser creators are adhering to the standards set by the W3C. [attachment_0](attachment)</p>
