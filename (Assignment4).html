    <title>Horizontal Rules Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Section One</h1>
    <p>This is the content of the first section. A horizontal rule will follow this paragraph to visually separate it from the next section.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Section Two</h2>
    <p>This is the content of the second section. The horizontal rule above clearly divides the two main topics.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Section Three</h3>
    <p>We can add as many horizontal rules as needed for stylistic or structural separation.</p>
